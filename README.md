Translating Pseudocode into C++ with AI Magic

This project uses **Transformer-based deep learning models** to convert **pseudocode into C++ code** automatically. The model is trained using **tokenization, sequence padding, and an encoder-decoder architecture** to learn the mapping between pseudocode and its corresponding C++ implementation.  

## **Features**  
‚úîÔ∏è Tokenizes pseudocode and applies padding, start, and end tokens  
‚úîÔ∏è Uses a **Transformer-based model** for accurate code translation  
‚úîÔ∏è Encoder processes the pseudocode, while the decoder generates C++ code  
‚úîÔ∏è Trained on a large dataset of pseudocode-to-C++ pairs  
‚úîÔ∏è Saves and reloads the model for inference  

## **Installation**  
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## **Usage**  
### **Training the Model**  
Run the training script to train the model:  
```python
python train.py
```

### **Generating C++ Code from Pseudocode**  
Load the trained model and test it with a sample input:  
```python
python infer.py
```

## **How It Works**  
1. **Tokenization & Padding**: Converts pseudocode into tokens and applies padding.  
2. **Transformer Model**: Uses an encoder-decoder architecture to process and translate text.  
3. **Prediction**: Generates C++ code based on the learned patterns.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Add support for multiple programming languages.  
- Improve accuracy with a larger dataset.  
- Deploy as a **web app** for real-time code conversion.
